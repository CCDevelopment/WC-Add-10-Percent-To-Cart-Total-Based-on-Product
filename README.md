# WC-Add-10-Percent-To-Cart-Total-Based-on-Product
Add 10% to the WC cart total if there's a specific product in the cart.

This is a Wordpress plugin that adds additional functionality to a Woocommerce store. 
The plugin adds a new option on the individual product edit screen that allows the user to select whether this product will trigger an overall cart total increase of 10% if it is in the cart. 
If the user sets the option to true, the cart total will be increased by 10% on the cart page. 
If mutliple items have the value set to true the cart total will still only be increased by 10% in total.

The plugin includes a free version of ACF for field generation/UI.
